# ObsidianSetMod
Minecraft mod that expands obsidian's purpose into tools, blocks and more.

These are the source files of my mod that allows the ability to make obsidian tools, bricks, and other crafting abilities. The main purpose of this mod is to give me an introduction to modding, and to give me an idea of what to expect when modding in the future.
